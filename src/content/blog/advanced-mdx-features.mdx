Welcome to the **Advanced Blog System**! This post demonstrates the powerful features available for writing technical content.

## Typography & Formatting

We use a beautiful, legible font stack optimized for reading. You can use **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, and [links](#).

> "The goal of this blog system is to provide a premium reading experience for technical content."

## Custom Callout Blocks

We have custom callout blocks for different types of content:

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Use callouts to highlight important information that shouldn't be missed.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
  Be careful when deploying to production without testing!
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Did you know?">
  Next.js 14 App Router uses React Server Components by default.
</Callout>

## Interactive Visualizations

You can embed interactive charts directly in your markdown:

<InteractiveChart 
  title="Model Training Loss"
  data={[
    { name: 'Epoch 1', loss: 0.8 },
    { name: 'Epoch 2', loss: 0.6 },
    { name: 'Epoch 3', loss: 0.4 },
    { name: 'Epoch 4', loss: 0.3 },
    { name: 'Epoch 5', loss: 0.25 },
  ]}
  dataKey="loss"
  color="#ef4444"
/>

## Code Blocks

We support syntax highlighting with line numbers and copy functionality:

```python showLineNumbers
def train_model(data, epochs=10):
    model = create_model()
    history = []
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        loss = model.fit(data)
        history.append(loss)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Loss = {loss:.4f}")
        
    return model, history
```

## ML Demos

You can even embed interactive ML demos:

<MLDemo />

## Conclusion

This system allows you to write rich, interactive technical content with ease. Enjoy writing!
