# Getting Started with MLOps

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.

## Why MLOps?

- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that models can be reproduced with the same data and code.
- **Scalability**: Managing the lifecycle of thousands of models.
- **Automation**: Automating the training and deployment pipelines.

## Key Components

1. **Data Versioning**: Tools like DVC.
2. **Model Registry**: Storing and versioning models (e.g., MLflow).
3. **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment for ML.
4. **Monitoring**: Tracking model performance in production.

## Conclusion

MLOps is essential for any organization looking to scale their AI efforts. Start small with version control and automated testing, then expand to full pipelines.
