# Cyclone Modeling using ODE/PDE

Cyclones are complex atmospheric phenomena driven by nonlinear interactions between pressure fields, temperature gradients, wind dynamics, and the Coriolis force.  
During my M1 Research Internship, I worked on a project focused on **numerically simulating cyclone behavior** using both **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** and **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**.

This work combined **mathematical modeling**, **numerical analysis**, and **scientific computing** to better understand the evolution of cyclone trajectories and their internal structure.

## 🌪️ Motivation

Cyclones represent one of the most destructive natural events. Accurately modeling their formation and evolution requires strong mathematical tools and efficient numerical solvers.

The project aimed to:

- Understand simplified atmospheric models using ODE/PDE formulations  
- Explore numerical schemes for convection-diffusion dynamics  
- Compare the behavior of different solvers  
- Analyze asymptotic behavior near the cyclone’s eye  
- Build visualizations to interpret simulated wind fields and pressure gradients

## 🧮 Mathematical Formulation

Two types of equations were examined:

### **1. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**
ODEs were used to describe simplified trajectories and radial profiles of cyclone motion.

Typical governing equations involve:
- Radial velocity  
- Pressure gradients  
- Coriolis-like terms  
- Simplified thermodynamic relationships  

### **2. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**
To represent more detailed dynamics (e.g., wind fields, vorticity), PDEs were considered.

Examples include:
- Convection–diffusion equations  
- Shallow-water-like approximations  
- Simplified Navier–Stokes-inspired models

## 🧪 Numerical Methods

To solve the ODEs and PDEs efficiently, I implemented several numerical techniques in Python.

### 🔹 **Lax–Friedrichs Scheme**  
Used for hyperbolic PDEs modeling convection.  
This scheme provides stability and is easy to implement, ideal for early prototyping of cyclone dynamics.

### 🔹 **Implicit Euler & θ-Method**  
Robust for stiff ODEs and equations representing dissipative processes.

### 🔹 **BDF (Backward Differentiation Formula)**  
A high-accuracy solver suited for stiff dynamics, used to benchmark the simpler methods.

### 🔹 **Cross-Method Validation**  
I developed a dedicated Python script to validate numerical solvers against each other:  
- Comparing trajectories  
- Measuring numerical error  
- Visualizing divergence between methods  
- Tracking stability regions

## 📊 Visualization & Analysis

Visualization was a key part of the project.  
Using **Matplotlib**, **NumPy**, and custom utility functions, I generated:

- Cyclone radial profiles  
- 2D wind field reconstructions  
- Heatmaps for pressure distributions  
- Time-evolution plots of key variables  
- Error evolution across solvers  

These visualizations helped identify stability issues, understand asymptotic behavior, and interpret physical meaning in the simulations.

## 🔬 Asymptotic Analysis

A significant part of the project involved studying the **near-eye region**, where certain model parameters approach singular behavior.

This required analyzing:

- What happens as the function \( a(\xi) \to 0 \)  
- How the radial solution behaves in this limit  
- Numerical artifacts vs. true physical behavior  
- Conditions under which the models remain stable  

This provided insights into the limitations of simplified cyclone models and how to refine them.

## 🧭 Results & Learnings

Through iterative simulations and solver comparisons, the project demonstrated:

- The importance of choosing appropriate numerical methods for stiff equations  
- How discretization impacts the physical validity of solutions  
- Strengths and weaknesses of Lax–Friedrichs vs. implicit schemes  
- How asymptotic limits reveal deeper structure in cyclone models  

This work served as a strong foundation for further research in atmospheric modeling, numerical methods, and scientific computation.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Cyclone modeling through ODEs and PDEs provides a rich intersection of mathematics, physics, and numerical analysis.  
This project helped me develop:

- A solid understanding of numerical simulation  
- Experience with ODE/PDE solvers  
- A robust workflow for testing and validating numerical methods  
- Visualization techniques for scientific data  
- Analytical skills for interpreting asymptotic behavior  

Future work may include extending the model to more realistic conditions, incorporating turbulence, or simulating cyclone interaction with external systems.
