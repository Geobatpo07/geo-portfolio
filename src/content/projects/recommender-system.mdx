# Recommender System using Goodbooks-10k

This project demonstrates how to build a recommender system using the Goodbooks-10k dataset.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to recommend books to users based on their reading history and ratings. We use collaborative filtering techniques to find similar users or items.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the recommendation algorithms (KNN, SVD).
- **Streamlit**: For creating a simple web interface (optional).

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and filtering out users with few ratings.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution of ratings and popular books.
3. **Model Building**:
    - **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommending books liked by similar users.
    - **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommending books similar to those the user liked.
    - **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**: Reducing dimensionality to find latent features.

## Results

The SVD model achieved an RMSE of 0.85 on the test set, providing accurate recommendations.

## Future Work

- Implement deep learning based recommenders (Neural Collaborative Filtering).
- Add a hybrid approach combining content-based and collaborative filtering.
