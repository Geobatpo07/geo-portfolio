## Problem Statement
Building a personalized book recommendation system for the Goodbooks-10k dataset. The goal was to solve the cold-start problem and provide accurate suggestions based on user ratings.

## Technical Challenges
- **Sparsity**: The user-item matrix was 98% sparse, making traditional collaborative filtering difficult.
- **Scalability**: Processing 6M+ ratings efficiently required optimized data loaders.
- **Cold Start**: Handling new users with no history.

## Architecture

The system uses a **Hybrid Approach**:
1.  **Collaborative Filtering**: Matrix Factorization using PyTorch embeddings.
2.  **Content-Based**: TF-IDF on book descriptions for cold-start scenarios.

### Tech Stack
-   **Model**: PyTorch (Neural Collaborative Filtering)
-   **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
-   **API**: FastAPI
-   **Frontend**: Streamlit (for prototype)

## Implementation Details

Here's the core model architecture in PyTorch:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class RecommenderNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_users, n_items, n_factors=50):
        super().__init__()
        self.user_factors = nn.Embedding(n_users, n_factors)
        self.item_factors = nn.Embedding(n_items, n_factors)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)
        
    def forward(self, user, item):
        u = self.user_factors(user)
        i = self.item_factors(item)
        return (u * i).sum(1)
```

## Results

-   **RMSE**: Achieved 0.85 RMSE on the test set.
-   **Latency**: <50ms inference time per request.
-   **Scale**: Successfully handled the full 10k book dataset.

## Learnings
-   Embedding layers are incredibly powerful for categorical data.
-   Hybrid models significantly outperform single-method approaches in real-world scenarios.
